- Delete unnecessary code, such as comments, etc.
- Improve performance of the recommendation algorithm
- Improve 'for you': take into account both book downloads and visualisations --> when a book is opened, note it in a new table. There will be a weight associated with the download and another with the viewing and both will be used to search for recommendations.
- Remove the Calibre dependency. Uploads will be direct by selecting an ePub file or from a compressed file containing multiple ePub files. Another option is to have an upload folder where files to be uploaded can be placed.
